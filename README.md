# hackrf applications

This res provides several hackrf applications. The '.grc' are the gnuradio applications and corresponding ".py" are generated by gnuradio. 

You can use gnuradio to run the grc file or run the python files with python.

## Software version

gnuradio 3.10 on ubuntu or Windows
python 3.9

## gps_sig_recorder

This application is a gps signal recorder. Three gps L1 signals are found and tracked correctly with Dannis's Matlab SDR in my last test. While a commercial receiver Piksi from Swift Navigation can get six gps L1 signal.

Note that all the settings in the osmocom source is important. And I suggest only minor changes be done on the parameters.

"**bias=1**" in the argument is tested useful in both Windows based and Ubuntu based gnuradio.

"**BB_VGA**" should not be too high because this amplifier brings much noise into noise. It can't be too low or it will introduce constant bias to the signal and make I and Q branch unbalanced. 38 tested good for gps signal recording.

"**IF_LNA**" should be its full value because this amplifier brings. 40 is set.

"**bandwidth**" is set at 4.75MHz currently when sampling rate is 10MHz. You can adjust this to see what happens. 

## signal_analyser

This application is just used to see the signals in the air. Four range bars are provided to adjust center frequency, amplifier enable/disable, LNA of IF and VGA of BB.
